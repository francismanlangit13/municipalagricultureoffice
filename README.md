This system comprises three user roles: admin, staff, and farmer. It is designed to deliver various services such as request management, reporting, and addressing concerns. The main focus of this system is monitoring, specifically the management of product expiration dates. This involves keeping track of expiration dates, generating reports in collaboration with farmers, and providing real-time notifications via SMS and email to ensure all farmer members are well-informed.
